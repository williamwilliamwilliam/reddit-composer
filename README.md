# reddit-composer
AngularJS/Material, Spring Boot web app that allows Reddit users to compose batch messages using their developer API credentials.

If you'd like to quickly use the webapp, download reddit-composer.zip. Extract both files to any folder. If you're running on Windows, run the batch file included. This will start the Spring Boot app and automatically launch your browser to the web app's main page. 

Alternatively, you can can just run the source as a Java/Spring Boot application within your IDE of choice.
